Instructions:


 - Include the file "ajax.js", "autosuggest.js" and "tools.js" in your web page in which you want to implement autosuggest function.

 - Provide your MySQL Host settings in the "dbconfig.php" file. Please note that the "dbconfig.php" and "autosuggest.php" file must be in the same directory in which the "ajax.js" and "tools.js" reside.
